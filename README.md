# remote-gateway
A script to configure a Debian installation as an Apache Guacamole server, using MyStart.Online for authentication.

## Installation
You can download directly from Github:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhicks6345789/remote-gateway/master/install.py > install.py; sudo python3 install.py; rm install.py
```

## Notes
Not finished yet - not ready for real-world use. Especially don't use on a Debian install you need for anything else.
